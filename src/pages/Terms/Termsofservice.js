                <h2>3. ORDERS, APPROVAL, RETURN POLICY</h2>
                <p>
                    Account and Credits. Before initiating an Order, You must
                    first register as a Customer and create a Linggo account.
                    You agree to keep all account information updated and
                    accurate at all times. Any personal information you provide
                    will be subject to the Linggo Privacy Policy.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Payment. Before initiating an Order, Customer must buy
                    sufficient Linggo credits for the Services you desire to
                    purchase. Linggo credits are non-refundable and can be
                    purchased here.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Linggo will apply gross-up calculation to the payment. This
                    means that the payment to Linggo must be made in cleared
                    funds, without any deduction or set-off and free and clear
                    of and without deduction for or on account of any taxes,
                    levies, imports, duties, charges, fees and withholdings of
                    any nature now or hereafter imposed by any governmental,
                    fiscal or other authority save as required by law. If you
                    are compelled to make any such deduction, you will pay
                    Linggo any additional amounts as are necessary to ensure
                    receipt by Linggo of the full amount it would have received
                    but for the deduction.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Order. Customer can initiate an Order by providing all the
                    required information via the Platform, including the Quality
                    Level for your translation as described in the Linggo
                    Quality Policy.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Client Materials. Customer is responsible for providing the
                    Client Materials to be translated, materials describing the
                    context of the translation, and all other necessary
                    materials (glossary guide, etc.) when placing the Order.
                    Linggo may make recommendations on which source materials
                    and in what format to provide source materials, but
                    ultimately the quality of the results will depend on the
                    clarity, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of the Customer’s
                    source materials and instructions provided.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Cancellations. Customer can cancel any Order if the project
                    has not yet been engaged by a Translator. It is not uncommon
                    for an Order to be engaged by a Translator immediately after
                    the Order is placed. To attempt to cancel an Order, Customer
                    can click the “cancel button” on the Job Details page while
                    awaiting a Translator, or contact Linggo customer support
                    directly at support@Linggo.com to inquire if the Order can
                    be cancelled. If the Order has been picked up by a
                    Translator, the Order cannot be cancelled and there will be
                    no refund of credits.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Delivery of Translated Works. Linggo cannot guarantee that a
                    particular Translator or that any Translator will choose to
                    engage on your Order. If the Order is completed by a
                    Translator, Linggo will return the Translated Works to
                    Customers according to the quality level specified in the
                    Order.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Linggo gives an estimated time for Service completion, but
                    cannot guarantee an exact delivery time. We will email you
                    when the Translated Works are ready for your review. Unless
                    otherwise expressly agreed by Linggo, time is not of the
                    essence for delivery or performance, and no delay shall
                    entitle you to reject any delivery.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Approval or Rejection. Upon Linggo’s notification of
                    delivery of the Translated Works, Customer will have
                    strictly 120 hours to review the Translated Works. Customer
                    may approve the Translated Works via the Platform. If
                    Customer does not take action via the Platform within the
                    120 hour review period, the Translated Works will be deemed
                    “Approved” and the Translator will be paid for the
                    Translated Works. Once “Approved”, no alterations,
                    revisions, or refunds of the Translated Works will be
                    provided.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Due to the nature of language translation, errors in
                    translations will inevitably occur. Customers may reject the
                    Translated Works within the 120 hour review period if it
                    reasonably determines that it does not meet the Quality
                    Level that was ordered. We will perform a quality audit and
                    typically get back to you within one business day of the
                    rejection. If Linggo determines that the Translated Works
                    that you have rejected did not meet the quality level
                    specified in the Order, then Linggo will honor the rejection
                    and provide a retranslation or allow the Order to be
                    cancelled.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Linggo’s liability will be limited to correcting the errors
                    or providing refund.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Disclaimer. You agree to review any Translated Works before
                    making such content public, and you expressly agree that
                    Linggo will not have any liability or indemnity obligations
                    to you based on the Translated Works if you fail to do so.

                    If you opt in to allow Linggo to use your Translated Works
                    as “public examples,” you grant Linggo a worldwide,

                    in connection with operating, promoting, and improving our
                    Services. This license continues even if you stop using our
                    Services.

                    In order to provide you and our other customers the best
                    possible translation and language services, we (and those we
                    work with) may use your Client Materials and Translated
                    Works to generally improve the Services (for example, fine
                    tune our turn around time estimates, or improve machine
                    translation and machine learning systems) and develop new
                    products or services ourselves or in partnership with third
                    parties. If we do this, we never make your Client Materials
                    or Translated Works publicly available.

                    Linggo may modify this TOS at any time. You should look at
                    the terms regularly. If you do not agree to the modified
                    terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that

                    If you do not comply with this TOS, and we don’t take action
                    right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any
                    rights that we may have (such as taking action in the
