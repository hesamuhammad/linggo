                        incorporated herein by reference. The NDA requires that,

                            For example, You may not discuss or share the

                        best interest of Gengo
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        a) Flag jobs that have problems It is possible for
                        Customer error or technical issues to occur on any job
                        processed by the Gengo system. If You notice problems
                        with a job, especially available ones, be proactive and
                        help the community. Flag the job using the “Flag
                        problems with this job” form in a job’s comments
                        section, and if necessary, post a support ticket
                        immediately. Possible “problems” in a job include:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        b) Do not add translation to comments Do NOT post Your
                        translation in the comments section of a job. A Customer
                        could use the translation from the comments section and
                        reject Your job, meaning You would not get paid for the
                        work You have done.

                    <p>
                        c) Respond quickly and professionally to Customers and
                        Gengo Carefully read the comments and queries from
                        Customers and answer them promptly, clearly, and in a
                        professional manner. Do not use abusive or profane
                        language. Do not give excuses or personal background
                        information to Customers. Try to resolve disputes
                        professionally, and efficiently. You are expected to be
                        responsive to alerts from Gengo and Customers, as most
                        communication is time sensitive (such as comments on a
                        job). You assume all responsibility for failure to read
                        correspondence or notices, including those that might
                        result in loss of Your compensation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        d) Do not lock off jobs You must only accept jobs that
                        You can work on straight away. Customers want
                        translations delivered quickly, and when You start a
                        job, no other translator can see or work on it. By
                        starting and not working on a job, You are abusing the
                        Service and translator community. This includes but is
                        not limited to:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        e) Meet deadlines When considering a job, make sure You
                        have the time, knowledge and skills to complete it by
                        the stated deadline. Do not start a job if You cannot
                        finish it on time. In extenuating circumstances where
                        You cannot complete a job, You must make every effort to
                        cancel it immediately.

                        waste translator time, reject translations unnecessarily
                        or make unreasonable requests. Gengo may remove (in its
